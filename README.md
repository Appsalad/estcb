EST-CB
======

Small demo application for the workshop I'm/ll present at the 2013 edition of the 
[INFOTEC](http://infotec.est.ipcb.pt/2013/) event at [Escola Superior de Tecnologia](http://www.ipcb.pt/EST/) 
in Castelo Branco.

The app is a HTML5 based application that shows some of existing data from the school's website. It is tested and 
targeted to run on iOS and Android devices.

The workshop is part of [Appsalad](http://appsalad.com)'s presence at the event on April 11th.
